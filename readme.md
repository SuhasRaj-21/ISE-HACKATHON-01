The CARE-BRIDGE: AI-Powered Remote Symptom Assessment and Triage System addresses a critical gap in current healthcare by integrating Real-Time Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) data with dynamic symptom triage, moving beyond the limitations of static online symptom checkers.
This innovative approach allows the system to perform Personalized Risk Stratification, utilizing an AI-driven Longitudinal Patient Model to detect subtle physiological deviations and generate proactive clinical alerts, thereby preventing symptomatic crises and reducing the misdirection of resources like unnecessary Emergency Room visits.
Built using a modern React/TypeScript frontend and a Node.js backend , the system ensures patients receive fast, accurate, and automated guidance toward the most appropriate next steps, delivering accessible and predictive 24/7 care.
